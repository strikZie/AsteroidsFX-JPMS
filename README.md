This is a project for SE4-KOM

<h1>Project</h1>

Project is the Asteroids game, with focus on component based software.

the project is structured with the main game implemented on the main branch, the main game is considered as both intro lab and the GameLab,
then subsequent excersizes are implemented on relevant branches with name of the excersize in question.
all of the excersizes have the main game as the base

e.g. the JavaLab is implemented on the branch JavaLab-ServiceLoader


<h1>Current Excersize: JavaLab - ServiceLoader</h1>
The current branch is the implementation of the JavaLab where we use ServiceLoader and no JPMS, 
but instead utilize META-INF/services to loosely couple, instead of module-info from JPMS
